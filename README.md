👋 Hi, I'm Michaela!

Welcome to my Read Me file, where I'll introduce myself and share some information about my interests, current learning journey, collaboration interests, 
and how to reach me.

👀 I'm interested in...

My main interests are in web and app development. I am most passionate about healthcare technology, as a Registered Nurse with experience in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit, I've seen the impact technology can have on patient care and the healthcare industry as a whole. Though I am open to all tech! 


🌱 I'm currently learning...

I'm currently focusing on front-end and back-end development languages. I've been working with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a solid foundation. As I progress, I'm also going to learn React, Node, SQL, and Python.

I also recently completed a certificate in business administration, which complements my healthcare background and provides an understanding of business processes.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on...

I'm interested in collaborations on projects related to health and organizational solutions. Whether it's developing apps that improve patient care, creating organizational tools, or any other ideas, I'm excited to work with people who have creative solutions to our healthcare and/or organizational problems.
