👋 Hi, I'm Michaela!

Welcome to my Read Me file, where I'll introduce myself and share some information about my interests, current learning journey, collaboration interests, 
and how to reach me.

👀 I'm interested in...

My primary interest lies in the world of web and app development. However, what truly fuels my passion is the intersection of technology and healthcare. 
As a Registered Nurse with experience in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), I've witnessed the profound impact technology can have on patient care and the 
healthcare industry as a whole. I'm particularly enthusiastic about developing health technologies that can improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare 
processes.

🌱 I'm currently learning...

In my pursuit of expanding my skills and knowledge in web and app development, I've embarked on a learning journey. I'm currently focusing on front-end and 
back-end development. I've been working with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a solid foundation. As I progress, I'm also keen to delve into 
React for front-end development, SQL for database management, and Python for its versatile applications.

Additionally, I recently completed a certificate in business administration, which complements my healthcare background and provides a well-rounded 
understanding of business processes and project management.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on...

I'm open to collaborations on projects related to health and organizational solutions. Whether it's developing apps that improve patient care, streamlining 
healthcare operations, or creating efficient organizational tools, I'm excited to work with individuals or teams who share a passion for using technology to
make a positive impact in these areas.
